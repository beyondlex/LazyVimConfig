## what is this

[set up nvim for astro](https://joschua.io/posts/2023/06/22/set-up-nvim-for-astro/)

```
Create a new file at nvim/after/queries/markdown/injections.scm:

; extends
((inline) @_inline (#match? @_inline "^\(import\|export\)")) @tsx
This Treesitter query will use the tsx parser for lines that start with import or export.
```

The content you provided is a Tree-sitter query file used for syntax highlighting or language injections within Neovim, specifically for Markdown files. 

### Explanation:
- **File Location**: `nvim/after/queries/markdown/injections.scm`
- **Purpose**: Extends the syntax highlighting or injection rules for Markdown files.
- **Content**:
  - `((inline) @_inline (#match? @_inline "^\(import\|export\)")) @tsx`: This line specifies that any inline code in Markdown matching the regular expression for JavaScript `import` or `export` statements should be highlighted as `tsx` (TypeScript with JSX).

### How it works:
1. **inline**: Represents inline code blocks within Markdown.
2. **#match?**: A function that checks if the inline content matches the specified pattern (`import` or `export` statements).
3. **@tsx**: Specifies the language to use for highlighting (in this case, TypeScript with JSX).

This rule helps in accurately highlighting or handling JavaScript import/export syntax within Markdown files.


`nvim/after/queries/markdown/injections.scm` 这个文件路径或文件名是遵循了什么约定吗?
```

```
Yes, the file path `nvim/after/queries/markdown/injections.scm` follows certain conventions used by Neovim and Tree-sitter:

1. **`nvim/after/`**: This directory is used for user-specific customizations that should be loaded after all default settings and plugins. It's part of Neovim's runtime path.

2. **`queries/markdown/`**: Indicates that the queries are specific to Markdown files. Tree-sitter uses this structure to organize language-specific queries.

3. **`injections.scm`**: The file name `injections.scm` is used to define Tree-sitter query patterns for syntax injections, which allow embedding other languages within Markdown.

This structure helps Neovim and Tree-sitter manage and apply custom syntax highlighting rules effectively.
